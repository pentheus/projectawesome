== Technical Specifications ==

===Programming Language===
C#

===Compiler===
Visual Studio 2008

===Libraries Used===
*Microsoft XNA Framework* 
*XNA Animation Library*

===Engine===
The main component of the engine will include a SceneManager that
stores lights, camera info, and world geometry. World geometry
will be stored in an octree scene graph. The SceneManager is also reponsible
for culling and drawing the scene.

The engine will also have a class that can write and parse an XML scene file. Within this file is a list of all objects in the scene, their relevant transformation data, and a section for light/material data. As the class parses the data, it should add objects
to the SceneManager's octree.

===Target Hardware===

*OS*: PC

===Requirements===

===Data Structures===
Octree: This data structure partitions a 3D space into 8 smaller nodes/cubes. Within each node is stored lighting information, and a list of game objects.

ModelInfo: This is essentially a wrapper for the XNA's model class. It contains information on the model's transformation data, and any materials that should be applied to it. Might also contain a pointer to the light that it is being illuminated by. This could save some computation time at runtime.

Exact Algorithms: ...

Back-up and version control: We are using SVN to store and backup our code.
