= Intro =
Just after sunset - call it dusk, call it twilight, it is a time when human intercourse takes on an unnatural cast, when nothing is quite as it appears, when the imagination begins to reach for shadows as they dissipate to darkness and living daylight can be scarred right out of you. It is the perfect time for our GAME!
